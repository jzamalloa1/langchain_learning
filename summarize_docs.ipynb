      "groups.\n",
      "For example, take the study summarized in Table 3.1. We said in the previous chapter that exchangeability clearly does not hold in this study because\n",

      "On the other hand, an imbalance in the distribution of independent outcome predictors L between the treated and the untreated is expected by\n",

      "receiving treatment depends on L. The study in Table 3.1 is such a conditionally randomized experiment: the treated and the untreated are not\n",

      "i.e., individuals in critical condition L = 1. In fact, if the only outcome predictor that is unequally distributed between the treated and the untreated is\n",

       "[Document(page_content='Chapter 3\\nOBSERVATIONAL STUDIES\\nConsider again the causal question “does one’s looking up at the sky make other pedestrians look up too?” After\\nconsidering a randomized experiment as in the previous chapter, you concluded that looking up so many times was\\ntoo time-consuming and unhealthy for your neck bones. Hence you decided to conduct the following study: Find\\na nearby pedestrian who is standing in a corner and not looking up. Then find a second pedestrian who is walking\\ntowards the first one and not looking up either. Observe and record their behavior during the next 10 seconds.\\nRepeat this process a few thousand times. You could now compare the proportion of second pedestrians who\\nlooked up after the first pedestrian did, and compare it with the proportion of second pedestrians who looked up\\nbefore the first pedestrian did. Such a scientific study in which the investigator observes and records the relevant\\ndata is referred to as an observational study.\\nIf you had conducted the observational study described above, critics could argue that two pedestrians may both\\nlook up not because the first pedestrian’s looking up causes the other’s looking up, but because they both heard\\na thunderous noise above or some rain drops started to fall, and thus your study findings are inconclusive as to\\nwhether one’s looking up makes others look up. These criticisms do not apply to randomized experiments, which is\\none of the reasons why randomized experiments are central to the theory of causal inference. However, in practice,\\nthe importance of randomized experiments for the estimation of causal effects is more limited. Many scientific\\nstudies are not experiments. Much human knowledge is derived from observational studies. Think of evolution,\\ntectonic plates, global warming, or astrophysics. Think of how humans learned that hot coffee may cause burns.\\nThis chapter reviews some conditions under which observational studies lead to valid causal inferences.\\n3.1 Identifiability conditions\\nIdeal randomized experiments can be used to identify and quantify average\\ncausal effects because the randomized assignment of treatment leads to exchangeability. Take a marginally randomized experiment of heart transplant\\nand mortality as an example: if those who received a transplant had not reFor simplicity, this chapter consid- ceived it, they would have been expected to have the same death risk as those\\ners only randomized experiments in\\nwhich all participants remain under follow-up and adhere to their\\nassigned treatment throughout the\\nentire study. Chapters 8 and 9 discuss alternative scenarios.\\nwho did not actually receive the heart transplant. As a consequence, an associational risk ratio of 0.7 from the randomized experiment is expected to equal\\nthe causal risk ratio.\\nObservational studies, on the other hand, may be much less convincing (for\\nan example, see the introduction to this chapter). A key reason for our hesitation to endow observational associations with a causal interpretation is the lack\\nof randomized treatment assignment. As an example, take an observational\\nstudy of heart transplant and mortality in which those who received the heart\\ntransplant were more likely to have a severe heart condition. Then, if those\\nwho received a transplant had not received it, they would have been expected\\nto have a greater death risk than those who did not actually receive the heart\\ntransplant. As a consequence, an associational risk ratio of 1.1 from the observational study would be a compromise between the truly beneficial effect of\\ntransplant on mortality (which pushes the associational risk ratio to be under\\n1) and the underlying greater mortality risk in those who received transplant\\n28 Observational studies\\n(which pushes the associ', metadata={}),\n",

The best explanation\\nfor an association between treatment and outcome in an observational study\\nis not necessarily a causal effect of the treatment on the outcome.\\nWhile recognizing that randomized experiments have intrinsic advantages\\nfor causal inference, sometimes we are stuck with observational studies to answer causal questions. What do we do? We analyze our data as if treatment\\nhad been randomly assigned conditional on measured covariates L—though we\\noften know this is at best an approximation. Causal inference from observational data then revolves around the hope that the observational study can be\\nviewed as a conditionally randomized experiment.\\nInformally, an observational study can be conceptualized as a conditionally\\nTable 3.1 randomized experiment if the following conditions hold:\\nL A Y\\nRheia 0 0 0\\nKronos 0 0 1\\nDemeter 0 0 0\\nHades 0 0 0\\nHestia 0 1 0\\nPoseidon 0 1 0\\nHera 0 1 0\\nZeus 0 1 1\\nArtemis 1 0 1\\nApollo 1 0 1\\nLeto 1 0 0\\nAres 1 1 1\\nAthena 1 1 1\\nHephaestus 1 1 1\\nAphrodite 1 1 1\\nPolyphemus 1 1 1\\nPersephone 1 1 1\\nHermes 1 1 0\\nHebe 1 1 0\\nDionysus 1 1 0\\n1. the values of treatment under comparison correspond to well-defined interventions that, in turn, correspond to the versions of treatment in the\\ndata\\n2. the conditional probability of receiving every value of treatment, though\\nnot decided by the investigators, depends only on measured covariates L\\n3. the probability of receiving every value of treatment conditional on L is\\ngreater than zero, i.e., positive\\nIn this chapter we describe these three conditions in the context of observational studies.

However, if\\nthe analogy between observational study and conditionally randomized experiment happens to be correct, then we can use the methods described in the\\nprevious chapter—IP weighting or standardization—to identify causal effects\\nfrom observational studies. We therefore refer to these conditions as identifiability conditions or assumptions. For example, in the previous chapter, we\\ncomputed a causal risk ratio equal to 1 using the data in Table 2.2, which arose\\nfrom a conditionally randomized experiment. If the same data, now shown in\\nTable 3.1, had arisen from an observational study and the three identifiability\\nconditions above held true, we would also compute a causal risk ratio equal to\\nRubin (1974, 1978) extended Ney- 1.\\nman’s theory for randomized experiments to observational studies.\\nRosenbaum and Rubin (1983) referred to the combination of exchangeability and positivity as weak\\nignorability, and to the combination\\nof full exchangeability (see Technical Point 2.1) and positivity as\\nstrong ignorability.\\nImportantly, in ideal randomized experiments the identifiability conditions\\nhold by design.

In that situation, there are other possible approaches to causal inference\\nfrom observational data, which require a different set of identifiability conditions.

For\\nexample, if the study in Table 3.1 had arisen from a conditionally randomized experiment in which the probability of\\nreceiving treatment depended on the value of L (and hence conditional exchangeability Y\\na⊥⊥A|L holds by design) then\\nwe showed in the previous chapter that the causal effect is identifiable: the causal risk ratio equals 1, without requiring\\nany further assumptions. However, if the data in Table 3.1 had arisen from an observational study, then the causal risk\\nratio equals 1 only if we supplement the data with the assumption of conditional exchangeability Y\\na⊥⊥A|L. To identify\\nthe causal effect in observational studies, we need an assumption external to the data, an identifying assumption.
